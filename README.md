3D Model loader using OpenGL and following the tutorials on LearnOpenGL

Some of the code was written by a group partner, mainly the skybox implimentation. The textures are free images I obtained online, they are either directly from the original DOOM or are recreations, I'm unsure.

The rest was made by me. The default level that can be loaded in is a recreation of the first level of DOOM. 
By going into the config files, you can make your own levels in a text editor, you can change the settings, and create your own setting presets to be loaded in.

Most fbx models should work when you spawn them in, so long as you have them in the right place inside the project files. I had troubles getting the materials to work all the time, the backpack that comes with the tutorial works perfectly, but other models sometimes don't get textured correctly.
